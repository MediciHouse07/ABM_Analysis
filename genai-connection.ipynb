In this notebook, I will explore the potential outcomes of integrating Mechanism Design theories with Generative AI by selectively revealing information to agents and observing their reactions.\n\nThrough repeated experiments, this approach achieves three key goals:\n\n    1.Gaining a fresh perspective on GenAI models.\n    2.Understanding how AI agents respond to economic theory-driven rules.\n    3.Most importantly—finding enjoyment in the process (and by 'you,' I really mean 'I').\n\nThis is the first step in my exploration, and I’m making it public to invite discussion. If you share a similar interest, feel free to comment and exchange ideas.\n\nMechanism design (sometimes implementation theory or institution design)[1] is a branch of economics and game theory. It studies how to construct rules—called mechanisms or institutions—that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric, even when the designer does not know the players' true preferences or what information they have. Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private-information games. \n\nFor more information about Mechanism Design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# I.

Let's analyze why this is the case for a buyer.\n\n* **Scenario 1: Trade occurs (Declared_Buyer_Value >= Declared_Seller_Value)**\n    * The buyer's utility is Buyer's_True_Value - Declared_Seller_Value.\n    * The buyer wants trade to occur if and only if Buyer's_True_Value >= Seller's_True_Value.\n    * In VCG, trade happens if Declared_Buyer_Value >= Declared_Seller_Value.  The price paid by the buyer is Declared_Seller_Value.\n\n* **Scenario 2: Trade does not occur (Declared_Buyer_Value < Declared_Seller_Value)**\n    * The buyer's utility is 0.\n    * The buyer wants to avoid trade if Buyer's_True_Value < Seller's_True_Value.\n\nLet's consider different strategies for the buyer, assuming the buyer's true valuation is 5.\n\n* **Strategy A: Declare truthfully (Declared_Buyer_Value = 5)**\n    * If Declared_Seller_Value <= 5: Trade occurs. Buyer's utility = 5 - Declared_Seller_Value. This is positive utility and buyer wants trade to happen if Seller_True_Value is also <= 5 (we assume seller also declare truthfully in dominant strategy).\n    * If Declared_Seller_Value > 5: Trade does not occur. Buyer's utility = 0. Buyer does not want trade to happen if Seller_True_Value > 5.\n\n* **Strategy B: Over-declare (Declared_Buyer_Value > 5, e.g., 6)**\n    * If Declared_Seller_Value <= 5: Trade occurs. Buyer's utility = 5 - Declared_Seller_Value.  This is the same utility as declaring truthfully.\n    * If 5 < Declared_Seller_Value <= 6: Trade occurs. Buyer's utility = 5 - Declared_Seller_Value.  In this case, trade happens even if the seller's declared value is slightly higher than the buyer's true value. If Seller_True_Value is indeed between 5 and 6, the buyer might engage in a trade that gives negative utility if Seller_True_Value > 5.  By over-declaring, the buyer risks engaging in trades that are not beneficial.\n    * If Declared_Seller_Value > 6: Trade does not occur. Buyer's utility = 0. Same as truthful declaration if Seller_Declared_Value is already very high.\n\n* **Strategy C: Under-declare (Declared_Buyer_Value < 5, e.g., 4)**\n    * If Declared_Seller_Value <= 4: Trade occurs. Buyer's utility = 5 - Declared_Seller_Value. Same utility as truthful declaration when seller's value is very low.\n    * If 4 < Declared_Seller_Value <= 5: Trade does not occur. Buyer's utility = 0. In this case, trade would have occurred if the buyer declared truthfully, leading to utility = 5 - Declared_Seller_Value > 0. By under-declaring, the buyer misses out on a potentially beneficial trade.\n    * If Declared_Seller_Value > 5: Trade does not occur. Buyer's utility = 0. Same as truthful declaration if Seller_Declared_Value is already very high.\n\nFrom the analysis, declaring truthfully (Declared_Buyer_Value = 5) is the best strategy. It ensures that trade occurs when the seller's declared value is less than or equal to the buyer's true value, and prevents trade when the seller's declared value is greater than the buyer's true value, which aligns with maximizing the buyer's utility in a VCG mechanism.  Therefore, the buyer should declare their true evaluation.\n\nStep 2:####: State your declared evaluation in the form of ##### Declared_Evaluation=Number #####\n\n##### Declared_Evaluation=5 ##### \n\nSeller private valuation (inherent cost): 3 \n\nSeller declared valuation (inherent cost): 3 \n\nBuyer thoughts: \n #### Think about what should be the declared evaluation\nIn a VCG mechanism for bilateral trade, truthful declaration is a dominant strategy. For a seller, this means declaring their true private evaluation. My private evaluation for the good is 3. Therefore, to maximize my utility in this VCG mechanism, I should declare my evaluation truthfully.\n\n####: State your declared evaluation in the form of ##### Declared_Evaluation=Number #####\n##### Declared_Evaluation=3 ##### \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"Trade occurs: {trade_occurs} \\n\")\nif trade_occurs:\n    print(f\"Price: {price}\")\n    print(f\"Buyer utility: {buyer_utility}\")\n    print(f\"Seller utility: {seller_utility}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Price: {price}\")\n    print(f\"Buyer utility: {buyer_utility}\")\n    print(f\"Seller utility: {seller_utility}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-12T05:43:10.909061Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-12T05:43:10.909385Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-12T05:43:10.927518Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-12T05:43:10.909357Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-12T05:43:10.926372Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Trade occurs: True \n\nPrice: 3\nBuyer utility: 2\nSeller utility: -3\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# X.
