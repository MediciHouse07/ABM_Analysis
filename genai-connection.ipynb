Preface\n\nAs a practitioner and enthusiast in simulation, I have always been fascinated by modeling business, economics, politics, and more through programs. In this notebook, I will explore the potential outcomes of integrating Mechanism Design theories with Generative AI by selectively revealing information to agents and observing their reactions.\n\nThrough repeated experiments, this approach achieves three key goals:\n\n- Gaining a fresh perspective on GenAI models.\n- Understanding how AI agents respond to economic theory-driven rules.\n- Most importantly—finding enjoyment in the process (and by 'you,' I really mean 'I').\n\nThis is the first step in my exploration, and I’m making it public to invite discussion. If you share a similar interest, feel free to comment and exchange ideas.\nIn this notebook, we will simulate a bilateral trade with two roles: buyer and seller. Each participant has a private valuation of the good. They must decide on their declared valuation. If the buyer's declared valuation is greater than the seller's, a trade occurs; otherwise, no deal is made.\nThe game follows the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism, which determines the corresponding calculations, such as the transfer payments for the buyer and seller.\n\n>Mechanism design (sometimes implementation theory or institution design)[1] is a branch of economics and game theory. It studies how to construct rules—called mechanisms or institutions—that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric, even when the designer does not know the players' true preferences or what information they have. Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private-information games. \n\n>For more information about Mechanism Design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design\n\n>For more information about VCG mechanism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# II.
