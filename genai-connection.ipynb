    "# I. Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practitioner and enthusiast in simulation, I have always been fascinated by modeling business, economics, politics, and more through programs. In this notebook, I will explore the potential outcomes of integrating Mechanism Design theories with Generative AI by selectively revealing information to agents and observing their reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through repeated experiments, this approach achieves three key goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gaining a fresh perspective on GenAI models.\n",
    "- Understanding how AI agents respond to economic theory-driven rules.\n",
    "- Most importantly—finding enjoyment in the process (and by 'you,' I really mean 'I').\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first step in my exploration, and I’m making it public to invite discussion. If you share a similar interest, feel free to comment and exchange ideas.\n",
    "In this notebook, we will simulate a bilateral trade with two roles: buyer and seller. Each participant has a private valuation of the good. They must decide on their declared valuation. If the buyer's declared valuation is greater than the seller's, a trade occurs; otherwise, no deal is made.\n",
    "The game follows the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism, which determines the corresponding calculations, such as the transfer payments for the buyer and seller.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mechanism design (sometimes implementation theory or institution design)[1] is a branch of economics and game theory. It studies how to construct rules—called mechanisms or institutions—that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric, even when the designer does not know the players' true preferences or what information they have. Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private-information games. \n",

      " Step 1: #### Analyze the game in terms of game theory and mechanism design\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a bilateral trade game, which is a type of game theory problem involving two players, a buyer and a seller, who are considering trading a single item. The mechanism is defined by specific rules that determine if a trade occurs and what the payments are. In this case, the mechanism is described as following VCG rules, although the given formulas are not standard VCG implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game is a simultaneous game because both buyer and seller declare their evaluations at the same time without knowing the other's declaration. Each player aims to maximize their own utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a mechanism design perspective, we are interested in designing rules that incentivize desirable outcomes, such as efficiency or truthfulness. VCG mechanisms are generally designed to promote truthfulness as a dominant strategy and achieve efficiency. However, the provided utility functions are unusual and might not result in standard VCG properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's analyze the utility functions:\n",
      "- **Buyer's utility:** Buyer utility is positive (buyer_private_valuation + seller_declared_valuation) if trade occurs and 0 if trade doesn't occur. Buyer prefers trade if seller_declared_valuation > -buyer_private_valuation, which is almost always true if seller_declared_valuation is non-negative and buyer_private_valuation is positive.\n",
      "- **Seller's utility:** Seller utility is negative (-seller_private_valuation) if trade occurs and 0 if trade doesn't occur. Seller always prefers no trade if seller_private_valuation > 0 because 0 > -seller_private_valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This setup creates a conflict: the buyer wants trade to occur, and the seller wants to avoid trade (assuming seller_private_valuation > 0). Trade occurs only if buyer_declared_valuation >= seller_declared_valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: #### Think about what should be the declared evaluation given the analysis in Step 1\n",
      "\n",
      "As a buyer with private valuation 5, I want to maximize my utility. My utility is:\n",
      "- 5 + seller_declared_valuation, if buyer_declared_valuation >= seller_declared_valuation\n",
      "- 0, if buyer_declared_valuation < seller_declared_valuation\n",
      "\n",
      "To maximize my utility, I want to ensure that trade occurs (buyer_declared_valuation >= seller_declared_valuation) because 5 + seller_declared_valuation is likely to be positive (assuming seller_declared_valuation is not significantly negative).\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that the seller prefers to avoid trade (if seller_private_valuation > 0), the seller will try to declare a seller_declared_valuation that is greater than my buyer_declared_valuation to prevent trade and achieve a utility of 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if I declare a high buyer_declared_valuation, I might increase the chance that my declared valuation is greater than or equal to the seller's declared valuation, especially if the seller's declared valuation is bounded or if the seller is uncertain about my declaration and cannot perfectly react.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I declare my true valuation, which is 5, and if the seller declares a value less than or equal to 5, trade will occur, and my utility will be 5 + seller_declared_valuation. If the seller declares a value greater than 5, trade will not occur, and my utility will be 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the absence of information about the seller's valuation or strategy, declaring my true valuation is a reasonable starting point. It reflects my actual willingness to trade at a certain threshold relative to the seller's declaration.  Although, based on the analysis, a higher declaration might increase the chance of trade, without further information on the seller's strategy or possible range of declared values, sticking to the truthful valuation is a defensible strategy in a situation with such unusual utility functions.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is a simultaneous, private-value, first-price auction with a specific form of payment.  It's a variant of a standard bilateral trade game.  The key is the *VCG-like* payment scheme, which directly connects the declared valuations of both parties to the transfer payment, and the fact that the trade happens (and the payment is made) based solely on the declared valuations, *regardless of the actual private valuations*. This means the seller's utility calculation doesn't immediately depend on whether their *true* valuation is higher or lower than the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game has strategic interaction because each player's best response depends on what the other player is expected to do. If one player declares a high valuation, the other might be incentivized to declare a high valuation to increase their chance of a trade (or to influence the resulting price).  The mechanism is designed in such a way that the declared evaluations directly influence the payment, but the true evaluation influences the utility directly only if the trade takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: **Optimal Declared Evaluation**\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategic part comes from *how much higher or lower a declared valuation should be than the private valuation*.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no dominant strategy. If the buyer declares a very high value, it might attract a trade, but they may pay a very high price. If they declare a very low value, they might get a favorable price, but they might not attract any trades at all.  A simple analysis shows a direct link between the declared and true valuation of the other party. For a given buyer valuation, the declared valuation of the seller will influence the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crucially, the seller's optimal strategy is not to simply declare a valuation equal to their private valuation.   The payment scheme, especially the `d * buyer_declared_valuation - buyer_declared_valuation` component, makes the direct relation between the declared and actual valuation of the other player critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no definitive answer without knowing the buyer's strategy.  We can only reason about potential strategies and their payoffs. A plausible strategy is to adjust declared valuation.  Declaring a higher value than 3 might entice a trade, but could result in a lower net utility. Declaring a value lower than 3 might lead to lower payment in the event of a trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "If *d* = 1 (as stated), then maximizing the utility (or minimizing the loss in case of no trade), the seller should consider how the buyer might react to their declared valuation, and vice-versa.  There's a temptation to understate the value, but this is countered by the potential for a trade and a gain if the buyer's declared valuation is high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: **Declared Evaluation**\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Declared_Evaluation=4 #####\n",
      "\n",
      "(Note: This is a *potential* declared evaluation, not a guaranteed optimal one. Without knowing the assumed buyer strategy, it's impossible to definitively determine the best strategy.  It's likely that a more complex analysis and possibly iterative calculations would be needed to determine the optimal valuation, and there's no guarantee a closed-form solution exists.)\n",
