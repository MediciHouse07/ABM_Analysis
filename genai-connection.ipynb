If trade occurs, the buyer pays the seller's declared valuation (s) and the seller receives the buyer's declared valuation (b).  For a buyer with a private valuation of 5, we need to consider the incentives to declare truthfully versus misreport.\n\nLet $v_b = 5$ be the buyer's true valuation and $v_s$ be the seller's true valuation (which is unknown to the buyer, but the buyer needs to consider possible ranges of $s$). Let $b$ be the buyer's declared valuation and $s$ be the seller's declared valuation.\n\nTrade happens if $b \\ge s$.\nIf trade happens, buyer's utility is $U_b = v_b - s = 5 - s$.\nIf trade does not happen, buyer's utility is $U_b = 0$.\n\nWe consider if declaring the true valuation $b = 5$ is the optimal strategy.\n\nCase 1: Assume the seller's declared valuation $s \\le 5$.\nIf the buyer declares $b = 5$, then trade happens because $5 \\ge s$. The buyer's utility is $5 - s \\ge 0$.\nIf the buyer declares $b > 5$, say $b = 6$, then trade happens because $6 \\ge s$. The buyer's utility is still $5 - s$. Declaring higher does not increase utility in this case, but it does not decrease it either.\nIf the buyer declares $b < 5$, say $b = 4$. If $s \\le 4$, then trade happens and utility is $5 - s$. If $4 < s \\le 5$, then trade does not happen, and utility is $0$. In this subcase ($4 < s \\le 5$), declaring $b=5$ would lead to trade and utility $5-s > 0$, while declaring $b=4$ leads to no trade and utility $0$. Thus, declaring $b=5$ is better than declaring $b=4$ when $4 < s \\le 5$.\n\nCase 2: Assume the seller's declared valuation $s > 5$.\nIf the buyer declares $b = 5$, then trade does not happen because $5 < s$.

In this situation, declaring $b = 5$ is better.\nIf the buyer declares $b < 5$, say $b = 4$. Then trade does not happen because $4 < s$. The buyer's utility is $0$.\n\nIn all scenarios, declaring the true valuation $b = 5$ seems to be a weakly dominant strategy. It ensures trade happens when $s \\le 5$ (which is efficient because $v_b = 5 \\ge s$ is potentially efficient if $v_s \\le s$) and prevents trade when $s > 5$ (which is efficient because $v_b = 5 < s$ is inefficient if $v_s \\ge s$).
