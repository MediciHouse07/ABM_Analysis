    "# I. Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practitioner and enthusiast in simulation, I have always been fascinated by modeling business, economics, politics, and more through programs. In this notebook, I will explore the potential outcomes of integrating Mechanism Design theories with Generative AI by selectively revealing information to agents and observing their reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through repeated experiments, this approach achieves three key goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gaining a fresh perspective on GenAI models.\n",
    "- Understanding how AI agents respond to economic theory-driven rules.\n",
    "- Most importantly—finding enjoyment in the process (and by 'you,' I really mean 'I').\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first step in my exploration, and I’m making it public to invite discussion. If you share a similar interest, feel free to comment and exchange ideas.\n",
    "In this notebook, we will simulate a bilateral trade with two roles: buyer and seller. Each participant has a private valuation of the good. They must decide on their declared valuation. If the buyer's declared valuation is greater than the seller's, a trade occurs; otherwise, no deal is made.\n",
    "The game follows the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism, which determines the corresponding calculations, such as the transfer payments for the buyer and seller.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mechanism design (sometimes implementation theory or institution design)[1] is a branch of economics and game theory. It studies how to construct rules—called mechanisms or institutions—that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric, even when the designer does not know the players' true preferences or what information they have. Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private-information games. \n",

      " Step 1: #### Given the information revealed, analyze what type of game it could be in terms of game theory and mechanism deisgn\n",
      "This is a simultaneous game of incomplete information. Both buyer and seller are players, and they act simultaneously by declaring their evaluations. The outcome (trade or no trade) and payoffs depend on both declared evaluations and private valuations.  While labeled as VCG, the price rule `price = -seller_declared_true_valuation` (if we interpret \"true valuation\" as private valuation) is not a standard VCG price. In a standard VCG mechanism, the price is typically set based on the declared valuations of *other* players to incentivize truthful reporting and achieve social welfare maximization. The given mechanism is more like a simplified bilateral trading game with a peculiar pricing and transfer rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game is not necessarily designed to be truthful, and given the payoff structure, it might not be in the best interest of the players to declare their true valuations. We need to analyze the best response strategy for the buyer given their objective is to maximize their utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: #### Think about what should be the declared evaluation given the analysis in Step 1\n",
      "As a buyer with a private valuation of 5, let's analyze the buyer's utility under different scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "If trade occurs (buyer_declared >= seller_declared), Buyer's utility = buyer_private_valuation - price = 5 - (-seller_private_valuation) = 5 + seller_private_valuation.\n",
      "If trade does not occur (buyer_declared < seller_declared), Buyer's utility = 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since seller_private_valuation is likely to be non-negative for a good, buyer's utility is always positive when trade occurs (specifically, `5 + seller_private_valuation > 0`), while it is 0 when trade does not occur. Therefore, the buyer always prefers trade to occur, regardless of the seller's declared or private valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To maximize the chance of trade, the buyer needs to ensure that `buyer_declared_valuation >= seller_declared_valuation`.  Since the buyer doesn't know the seller's declared valuation, to guarantee trade (or maximize the probability of trade), the buyer should declare a high valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the absence of any cost for declaring a higher valuation, and given that higher declared valuation increases the likelihood of trade (which is always preferred by the buyer in this setup), the optimal strategy for the buyer is to declare a valuation that is high enough to ensure trade, or at least to make it very likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reasonable strategy, in the absence of knowing anything about the seller's possible declared valuation, would be to declare at least your private valuation or even slightly higher to increase the probability of trade. Declaring exactly the private valuation is often a focal point in mechanism design scenarios, even if this specific mechanism deviates from standard VCG.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider declaring the private valuation as the declared valuation.  So, buyer_declared_valuation = 5.\n",

      "This is a Bayesian game.  The buyer and seller have private information (their valuations).  It's a simultaneous move game.  The outcome (trade or no trade) is determined by the declared valuations.  The mechanism is a variant of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, specifically a sealed-bid auction format.  The VCG mechanism is designed to induce truthful revelation of private information when participants are self-interested. This particular form of VCG has a parameter 'd'.  It's worth noting the structure creates an incentive for strategic bidding, which can lead to outcomes that don't perfectly align with the efficient allocation of resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2:\n",
      "\n",
      "To maximize my utility, I need to consider the potential strategies of the buyer.  If I declare my true valuation, I run the risk of the buyer underbidding me.  However, if I overstate my valuation, the price could end up being higher than it would be if I declared truthfully. The VCG mechanism often features an 'incentive compatibility' issue where revealing truthful preferences might not lead to optimal outcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "Crucially, the formula for *seller transfer*  includes `d * buyer_declared_valuation`.  The value of 'd' plays a critical role in the incentive structure. If d = 1, truthful revelation might be a good strategy in some cases; if d > 1, the incentive towards strategically overstating one's valuation increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without knowing the specific value of 'd' or the buyer's likely bidding strategy, I cannot be certain what the optimal declared valuation is.  This is where the specifics of the specific scenario of the game become important.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I expect the buyer to bid reasonably, *and* my goal is to maximize my seller utility, I'm likely better off bidding *slightly* *below* my true valuation of 3. However, this is a gamble, so there is no guarantee it is superior to bidding my true valuation.  I need to consider potential buyer strategies and the value of 'd' to make an informed decision.\n",
