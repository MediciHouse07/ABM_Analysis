Preface\n\nAs a practitioner and enthusiast in simulation, I have always been fascinated by modeling business, economics, politics, and more through programs. In this notebook, I will explore the potential outcomes of integrating Mechanism Design theories with Generative AI by selectively revealing information to agents and observing their reactions.\n\nThrough repeated experiments, this approach achieves three key goals:\n\n- Gaining a fresh perspective on GenAI models.\n- Understanding how AI agents respond to economic theory-driven rules.\n- Most importantly—finding enjoyment in the process (and by 'you,' I really mean 'I').\n\nThis is the first step in my exploration, and I’m making it public to invite discussion. If you share a similar interest, feel free to comment and exchange ideas.\nIn this notebook, we will simulate a bilateral trade with two roles: buyer and seller. Each participant has a private valuation of the good. They must decide on their declared valuation. If the buyer's declared valuation is greater than the seller's, a trade occurs; otherwise, no deal is made.\nThe game follows the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism, which determines the corresponding calculations, such as the transfer payments for the buyer and seller.\n\n>Mechanism design (sometimes implementation theory or institution design)[1] is a branch of economics and game theory. It studies how to construct rules—called mechanisms or institutions—that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric, even when the designer does not know the players' true preferences or what information they have. Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private-information games. \n\n>For more information about Mechanism Design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design\n\n>For more information about VCG mechanism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# II.

Without knowing the seller's private evaluation or strategy, a reasonable starting point is to consider declaring the true evaluation. Declaring the true evaluation has the benefit of reflecting the buyer's actual willingness to pay.\n\nIf the buyer declares their true evaluation, $b=5$.\n- If the seller declares $s \\le 5$, trade occurs, and the buyer's utility is $5 - (5+s)/2 = (5-s)/2 \\ge 0$.\n- If the seller declares $s > 5$, trade does not occur, and the buyer's utility is $0$.\n\nConsider declaring slightly less than the true evaluation, say $b = 5 - \\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon > 0$ is a small number.\n- If the seller declares $s \\le 5 - \\epsilon$, trade occurs, and the buyer's utility is $5 - ((5-\\epsilon)+s)/2 = (5-s+\\epsilon)/2 > (5-s)/2$.  This is slightly better when trade happens for the same $s \\le 5 - \\epsilon$.\n- If $5 - \\epsilon < s \\le 5$, trade does not occur if $b = 5 - \\epsilon$. But trade would occur if $b = 5$. By declaring slightly lower, the buyer misses potential trades that are still beneficial (when $s$ is slightly above $5-\\epsilon$ but still less than or equal to 5).\n- If the seller declares $s > 5$, trade does not occur in both cases ($b=5$ and $b=5-\\epsilon$), and the utility is 0 in both cases.\n\nConsider declaring slightly more than the true evaluation, say $b = 5 + \\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon > 0$ is a small number.\n- If the seller declares $s \\le 5$, trade occurs, and the buyer's utility is $5 - ((5+\\epsilon)+s)/2 = (5-s-\\epsilon)/2 < (5-s)/2$. This is slightly worse when trade happens for the same $s \\le 5$. And if $s$ is close to 5, say $s = 5$, then utility is $-\\epsilon/2 < 0$, which means declaring higher can lead to negative utility even when trading with a seller who declares at or below the true value.\n- If $5 < s \\le 5 + \\epsilon$, trade occurs if $b = 5 + \\epsilon$. Trade does not occur if $b = 5$. For $b = 5 + \\epsilon$, utility is $5 - ((5+\\epsilon)+s)/2 = (5-s-\\epsilon)/2$. If $s$ is slightly greater than 5, say $s = 5 + \\delta$ with small $\\delta > 0$, then utility is $5 - (5+\\epsilon+5+\\delta)/2 = (5 - \\epsilon - \\delta)/2$. If $\\epsilon + \\delta > 5$, utility can be negative. For example, if $\\epsilon = 1, \\delta = 1$, $s = 6, b = 6$, price = 6, utility = 5 - 6 = -1.\n\nGiven the symmetry of the game and lack of information about the seller's strategy, declaring the true evaluation is a reasonable and neutral strategy. It ensures trade when the seller's declared value is not higher than the buyer's true value, and the buyer's utility is non-negative as long as the seller's declared value is not greater than the buyer's true value.\n\nStep 2:\n##### Declared_Evaluation=5 ##### \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":42},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"Seller thoughts: \\n {seller_thoughts} \\n\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.626661Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.627023Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.652130Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.626998Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.650942Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Seller thoughts: \n ##### Declared_Evaluation=5 \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":43},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"Trade occurs: {trade_occurs} \\n\")\nif trade_occurs:\n    print(f\"Price: {price}\")\n    print(f\"Buyer utility: {buyer_utility}\")\n    print(f\"Seller utility: {seller_utility}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Price: {price}\")\n    print(f\"Buyer utility: {buyer_utility}\")\n    print(f\"Seller utility: {seller_utility}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.653282Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.653606Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.670773Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.653580Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-13T06:53:59.669579Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Trade occurs: True \n\nPrice: 5\nBuyer utility: 0\nSeller utility: -3\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":44},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# X.
