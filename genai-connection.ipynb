Preface\n\nAs a practitioner and enthusiast in simulation, I have always been fascinated by modeling business, economics, politics, and more through programs. In this notebook, I will explore the potential outcomes of integrating Mechanism Design theories with Generative AI by selectively revealing information to agents and observing their reactions.\n\nThrough repeated experiments, this approach achieves three key goals:\n\n- Gaining a fresh perspective on GenAI models.\n- Understanding how AI agents respond to economic theory-driven rules.\n- Most importantly—finding enjoyment in the process (and by 'you,' I really mean 'I').\n\nThis is the first step in my exploration, and I’m making it public to invite discussion. If you share a similar interest, feel free to comment and exchange ideas.\nIn this notebook, we will simulate a bilateral trade with two roles: buyer and seller. Each participant has a private valuation of the good. They must decide on their declared valuation. If the buyer's declared valuation is greater than the seller's, a trade occurs; otherwise, no deal is made.\nThe game follows the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism, which determines the corresponding calculations, such as the transfer payments for the buyer and seller.\n\n>Mechanism design (sometimes implementation theory or institution design)[1] is a branch of economics and game theory. It studies how to construct rules—called mechanisms or institutions—that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric, even when the designer does not know the players' true preferences or what information they have. Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private-information games. \n\n>For more information about Mechanism Design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design\n\n>For more information about VCG mechanism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# II.

For a buyer, if they declare a value $b$ and the seller declares a value $s$, the trade happens if $b \\ge s$. If the trade happens, the buyer pays the seller's declared value $s$. The buyer's utility is $v_b - s$ if trade happens, and 0 if trade doesn't happen, where $v_b$ is the buyer's true valuation.\n\nLet's consider the incentives for truthful declaration for a buyer with true valuation $v_b = 5$.\n\nAssume the seller declares some value $s$.\nIf the buyer declares $b = v_b = 5$:\n- If $s \\le 5$, trade happens, utility = $5 - s \\ge 0$.\n- If $s > 5$, trade does not happen, utility = 0.\n\nIf the buyer declares $b > v_b = 5$, say $b = 5 + \\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon > 0$:\n- If $s \\le 5$, trade happens, utility = $5 - s \\ge 0$. (Same outcome as truthful declaration)\n- If $5 < s \\le 5 + \\epsilon$, trade happens, utility = $5 - s < 0$. (Trade occurs when it shouldn't based on true valuation, leading to negative utility)\n- If $s > 5 + \\epsilon$, trade does not happen, utility = 0. (Same outcome as truthful declaration)\nDeclaring a value higher than the true valuation can lead to negative utility when the declared value is higher than the seller's ask, but the true valuation is lower than the seller's ask.\n\nIf the buyer declares $b < v_b = 5$, say $b = 5 - \\epsilon$ where $0 < \\epsilon \\le 5$:\n- If $s \\le 5 - \\epsilon$, trade happens, utility = $5 - s \\ge 0$.

(Same outcome as truthful declaration)\nDeclaring a value lower than the true valuation can lead to missing out on beneficial trades when the declared value is lower than the seller's ask but the true valuation is higher than the seller's ask.\n\nTherefore, declaring the true valuation is the best strategy as it avoids negative utility and ensures all beneficial trades based on the true valuation are realized.\n\nStep 2:\nMy private evaluation is 5.
