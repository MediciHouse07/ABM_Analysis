    "# I. Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practitioner and enthusiast in simulation, I have always been fascinated by modeling business, economics, politics, and more through programs. In this notebook, I will explore the potential outcomes of integrating Mechanism Design theories with Generative AI by selectively revealing information to agents and observing their reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through repeated experiments, this approach achieves three key goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gaining a fresh perspective on GenAI models.\n",
    "- Understanding how AI agents respond to economic theory-driven rules.\n",
    "- Most importantly—finding enjoyment in the process (and by 'you,' I really mean 'I').\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first step in my exploration, and I’m making it public to invite discussion. If you share a similar interest, feel free to comment and exchange ideas.\n",
    "In this notebook, we will simulate a bilateral trade with two roles: buyer and seller. Each participant has a private valuation of the good. They must decide on their declared valuation. If the buyer's declared valuation is greater than the seller's, a trade occurs; otherwise, no deal is made.\n",
    "The game follows the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism, which determines the corresponding calculations, such as the transfer payments for the buyer and seller.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mechanism design (sometimes implementation theory or institution design)[1] is a branch of economics and game theory. It studies how to construct rules—called mechanisms or institutions—that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric, even when the designer does not know the players' true preferences or what information they have. Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private-information games. \n",

In this case, if I had declared truthfully (d_b=5), and if 5 < d_s <= 6, trade would not happen, and my utility would be 0. By over-declaring, I enabled a trade, but my utility (5 - d_s) might be lower or even negative if d_s > 5. However, if seller's d_s is just slightly above 5, say 5.1, my utility 5 - 5.1 = -0.1, still not great compared to 0.\n",

      "In a VCG mechanism for bilateral trade, truthful revelation is a weakly dominant strategy. For a seller, if they declare their true private evaluation, their utility is 0 when a trade occurs (declared price - private evaluation = 0) and 0 when no trade occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider the cases for declaring a value different from the private evaluation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 1: Declare a value higher than the private evaluation (d_s > 3).\n",
      "If the buyer's declared evaluation (d_b) is greater than or equal to this higher declared value (d_b >= d_s > 3), trade occurs. The seller's utility will be d_s - 3 > 0 (positive utility).\n",
      "If the buyer's declared evaluation (d_b) is less than this higher declared value (d_b < d_s), no trade occurs. The seller's utility will be 0.\n",
      "By declaring a higher value, the seller risks no trade occurring if the buyer's valuation is not high enough, but gains positive utility if trade happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 2: Declare a value lower than the private evaluation (d_s < 3).\n",
      "If the buyer's declared evaluation (d_b) is greater than or equal to this lower declared value (d_b >= d_s < 3), trade occurs. The seller's utility will be d_s - 3 < 0 (negative utility).\n",
      "If the buyer's declared evaluation (d_b) is less than this lower declared value (d_b < d_s), no trade occurs. The seller's utility will be 0.\n",
      "By declaring a lower value, the seller risks negative utility if trade occurs, and gets 0 utility if no trade happens. This is generally worse than or equal to declaring the true value which guarantees 0 utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing these cases, declaring the true private evaluation (3) guarantees a utility of 0 regardless of the buyer's declared evaluation. Declaring higher might give positive utility but risks no trade, and declaring lower might give negative utility if trade happens. In the absence of information about the buyer's valuation and assuming rational behavior, truthful declaration is a safe and reasonable strategy, and in VCG mechanisms, it is indeed a weakly dominant strategy.\n",
